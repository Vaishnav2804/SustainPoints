Idea Overview/Map:

Sustainability Points:

This idea aims at the Accessibility and inclusiviness portion of the hackathon.


Sustainability Points are motivators for people to spend and use with sustainability in mind.
Similiar to how air-miles or scene+ motivate you to spend when buying groceries and give you rewards after spending.

Research has shown that these sort of programs really help users to be more sustainable:
1. Randomized field experiment (2024, Environmental & Resource Economics): giving shoppers individualized carbon feedback in a grocery app reduced emissions ~27% in month 1 (esp. beef), with effects fading as app engagement waned (persistence among engaged users). This is the strongest causal evidence to cite. 
2. Visa “Eco Benefits” (powered by ecolytiq) and NatWest’s Carbon Tracker show mainstream adoption of transaction-based footprinting, with Visa explicitly positioning rewards tied to sustainable behaviors. 
3. Clarity AI’s study of ecolytiq users reports shifts toward lower-emission choices without reducing overall spending (directional, not an RCT). Handy for a “market validation” slide. 
4. Points-for-behavior schemes have worked in health contexts (e.g., physical-activity loyalty programs via randomized trials), which supports the general mechanism of “points change habits.”

According to both the cateogory of spending and the amount spent, the user will get a corresponding sustainability point.


The user can then spend their points to:

1. Tax Redemption
    By partnering with willing countries we can give access to our dataset to give citizens tax credits similar to when citizens buy an EV vehicle or solar panels

2. Reduce price of EV vehicle


3. Reduce price of solar panels


4. Reduce price of insulation


5. Reduce price of second hand goods


6. Reduce price of public transporation passes


There are 5 cateogries of spending that a user can earn points from:

1. Purchasing Refurbished item such as second hand electronics or clothes
    By reading the user's bank account transactions we can detect where they have spent money, and if it fits within this category.
    Each dollar spent in this cateogory will earn the user 5 points.

2. Paying for public transportation such as metro, bus, or tram
    By reading the user's bank account transactions we can detect where they have spent money, and if it fits within this category.
    Each dollar spent in this cateogory will earn the user 10 points.

3. Purchasing items that promote renewable energy and energy conservation uses such as solar panels or good house insulation.
    By reading the user's bank account transactions we can detect where they have spent money, and if it fits within this category.
    Each dollar spent in this cateogory will earn the user 20 points.

4. Depending on how much money they have been able to save on utilities (water and power)
    Since each person and each household will have their own personal usage patterns we need to learn about them. 
    After we understand how their usage patterns, we can give them points when they are below their average usage.
    This feature would take a year to fully develop. Because of this the first month we will not give any points for this and then during the first year the points will be less than normal.
    Ideally we want the usage to update as the person changes and become more sustainable. so if they use 10% less power than last year, then earning points should become 10% harder next year.
    Each dollar saved in this cateogory will earn the user 5 points.

5. Money earned from recyclying water bottles at stations
    By having a Sustain card that the user can tap at select recylcying stations, they can earn points depending on the products they are recyclying and how much
